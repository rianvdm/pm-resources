# LLM Prompts

System prompts for working with LLMs on common product management tasks. These are designed to be used as custom instructions or system prompts in tools like Claude, ChatGPT, or other LLM interfaces.

## How to Use

1. Copy the contents of a prompt file
2. Paste it into your LLM's system prompt or custom instructions
3. For best results, add your own context files covering:
   - **About you** — Your role, responsibilities, and what you're working on
   - **Your leadership/product philosophy** — How you approach decisions, collaboration, and communication
   - **Style preferences** — Tone, structure, and formatting you prefer in responses

- **Outcomes over outputs** — Focus on the change you want to see, not activities

- **Clarity over comprehensiveness** — Short, direct, high-signal communication
- **Empowered teams** — Provide context and goals, trust teams to find the best approach
