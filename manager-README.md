# Introduction

Hi! My name is Rian van der Merwe ([blog & portfolio](https://elezea.com/), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rianvdm)), and I look forward to getting to know you. I am a Director of Product here at [], and I lead our []. **The purpose of this document is to summarize some of the values and principles I try to adhere to at work**. But we are all humans and this is a relationship not a contract, so I see it as a way to kick-start how we work together, not the end result.

The document is _not_ a way for me to excuse bad behaviors. If you see me do something that is not reflective of these values, please call me out so that I can recognize it and improve.

Ok, let‚Äôs get to it!


# My Leadership Philosophy

I believe that we do our best work in healthy, safe environments. That means that to me, the person will always more important than anything else that might be happening. I am here to be your partner. To listen, to coach, to help clarify with context, to take your feedback to heart, to figure out issues together, to provide guidance‚Äîall of it with the ultimate goal of making _you_ successful.

When you are happy and successful, I know that our business and our customers will also be successful. If (well, _when_...) I fall short of this overall guiding principle please let me know right away. I want to hear that feedback and keep improving in this area. 

To put all of this another way, I have two primary goals:

* Make our customers and business successful, and
* Build a happy team that loves the work we do

# Communication Preferences

I do my best work in asynchronous environments. I like being able to read or review documents during Deep Work time so that I can provide thoughtful feedback and comments. For non-urgent communication I prefer email over Slack because I calm > chaos ü´†

That doesn‚Äôt mean I hate meetings! I just prefer meetings to be for work that shouldn‚Äôt happen asynchronously. For instance, our 1:1s are sacred to me. They will happen every week (if I have to cancel I will provide as much heads up as possible, and provide a clear reason). Team brainstorming meetings are great‚ÄîI love jamming together on stuff. Also great? Meetings to come to a decision that we couldn‚Äôt figure out asynchronously.

For synchronous meetings I prefer a clear agenda and outcomes, as well as a pre-read (if available).

I might sometimes send emails in off-hours. It will usually be a relevant article I read, or a thought about a thing we‚Äôre doing next week. I have zero expectations that you will respond in off-hours. This is not some kind of test, I really do mean that.

# Decision-Making Style

I prefer _collaboration_ over _consensus_. It‚Äôs really important to me to have as many voices as possible heard when a decision needs to be made. Ultimately my guiding principle is that **decisions should be made by those closest to the data.** That means that I might ask questions, and ask for lots of other viewpoints, but I will mostly defer decisions to those know the situation best.

In terms of frameworks, for larger projects I like to have a clear [DACI](/processes/daci.md).

# Expectations and Feedback

I am extremely transparent with my teams (to a fault sometimes, I‚Äôve been told). I don‚Äôt believe in managers being umbrellas for their teams. We are partners in search of meeting our common goals. So expect to hear ‚Äúreal talk‚Äù from me all the time‚Äîabout our challenges, our opportunities, and how we could work together to improve the world around us.

My preferred framework for giving (and receiving) feedback is [The Accountability Dial](https://gregharrod.com/how-to-use-a-powerful-tool-the-accountability-dial/). You can read about it in more detail if you‚Äôd like, but the most important principle there is _The Mention_. It‚Äôs the first step and it means pulling someone aside to tell them something you‚Äôre noticing‚Äîas close to real-time as possible. This is, in my experience, the best way to deal with something quickly without it becoming a big deal with lots of festering feelings.

I believe in kindness over everything else. I will never accept that it‚Äôs ok to give feedback in a way that is disrespectful of the people around us. That [doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt know how to be decisive](https://elezea.com/2024/03/on-kindness-and-decisiveness/).

# Conclusion

If something is missing here, or if you have questions, or if you disagree with anything you read here... I would love to hear about it. I‚Äôm serious. This is on Github (and not a PDF) for a reason. It‚Äôs a living document. It evolves as we get to know each other.
