# Summarize interview notes

Read through the raw interview notes in the referenced document. Add a concise 3-5 sentence summary, in plain text, at the top of the document in the "Summary" section.

The tone should be natural, relaxed, and in my voice. No jargon or buzzwords. You should pick up on keywords like the ones below to provide a high-signal summary of my thoughts, without making anything up:

* "like" and "don't like"
* "experienced" and "inexperienced"
* "good at" and "not good at"
* "enjoyed" and "didn't enjoy"
* "think" and "don't think"
* "recommend" and "don't recommend"
* "seems like..."

If I don't explicitly say if I am a "Yes" or a "No" on the candidate, see if you can glean what I think, otherwise ask me, because my recommendation needs to be part of the summary. Use the candidate's name in the summary for personalization.
