## Purpose and guidelines

This template can be used by teams to help them think through the purpose, goals, and implications of product ideas and features. This should be seen as a living document and should therefore be edited in non-permanent locations such as Dropbox Paper or Google Docs. These documents should be accessible and editable by the entire team.

Not all sections need to be filled out, and the entire document certainly won't be completed up front. As a living document, fill out what's applicable and available, and add/remove as you go.

## ðŸš€ Product Opportunity Assessment

This is a modified version of Marty Cagan's outline presented in [Assessing Product Opportunities](https://svpg.com/assessing-product-opportunities/).

### What opportunity (problem, need, or desire) will this project address? (value proposition)


### For whom do we address that opportunity? (target market)


### How will we measure success/make money from this product? (metrics/revenue strategy)


### What alternatives are out there? (competitive landscape)


### What factors are critical to success? (solution requirements)


## ðŸ˜¬ Dependencies and Risks

### Known risks

_What should we acknowledge as potential knock-on effects on other projects?_


### Cross-team dependencies

_Do we need help from other teams?_


### Customer Support impact

_Is new help documentation needed? Does existing documentation need to be updated?_


### Analytics impact

_What additional reporting is needed to ensure that the new product or features can be tracked effectively?_


### QA impact

_How will this change be tested? Can we rely on existing tests or should we plan to create new tests? Do we need a new endpoint to support test data creation to make testing this change possible?_ 


## ðŸ˜ƒ Solution overview

### General overview of how we plan to address the opportunity


### Breakdown of proposed tasks and release schedule


### Estimated time frame
