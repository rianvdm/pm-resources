# Draft Feedback Prompt

Use this prompt to transform raw feedback notes into polished, capability-aligned feedback for peer reviews, 360s, or performance evaluations.

---

## Prompt

```
Read the context files for background on my role and communication style:
- [about-me.md]
- [personalization-instructions.md]

Then help me rewrite the raw feedback notes into polished feedback. Frame each response within the relevant Cloudflare Capabilities listed at the bottom.

Guidelines:
- Map strengths and examples explicitly to specific capabilities (bold the capability names)
- Preserve concrete examples and specific project references
- Keep the tone professional yet informal/natural—avoid corporate fluff
- Use bullet points for multiple examples to improve scannability
- If I don't have development areas to call out, frame it honestly while still tying to a capability
